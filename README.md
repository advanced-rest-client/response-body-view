## &lt;response-body-view&gt;

An element to display a HTTP response body in accessible and human readable form.

```html
<response-body-view responsetext="# Hello world" contenttype="application/markdown"></response-body-view>
```

Note, the element internally uses `TextDecoder` class for responses that are an `ArrayBuffer` instead of text. If the response can be an `ArrayBuffer` you need to ensure the `TextDecoder` class is supported / polyfilled.

npm install --save @advanced-rest-client/response-body-view

## Breaking Changes in v3

-   XML custom view has been replaced with Prism syntax highlighting
-   Prism parsing timeout is no longer supported, it wasn't working well anyway
-   Response preview has been removed, it couldn't reliably render response view
